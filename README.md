# Web2All file

This `web2all/file` package requires the `web2all/framework` ([https://github.com/web2all/framework](https://github.com/web2all/framework)). It used to be proprietary software but now it has been released to the public domain under a MIT license.

This pacckage is no longer actively maintained. Most likely it is only of interest if you own software created by Web2All B.V. which was built using these classes.

## What does it do ##

Filesystem abstraction layer. Exposes methods to manipulate files/directories on a filesystem. Includes drivers for unix filesystem and ftp filesystem.

When using the ftp filesystem the Pear `Net_FTP` package ([https://pear.php.net/package/Net_FTP](https://pear.php.net/package/Net_FTP)) is also needed.

## License ##

Web2All framework is open-sourced software licensed under the MIT license ([https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT "license")).
